# 🌱 pH Sensor and Moisture Detection System – ECE

## 📌 Project Overview
This ECE project uses pH and soil moisture sensors with Arduino UNO to monitor soil health.  
It supports smart agriculture by providing real-time soil condition data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure soil pH levels accurately.
- Detect soil moisture percentage.
- Display readings via Serial Monitor or LCD.
- Enable calibration for different soil types.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Analog pH sensor
- Capacitive soil moisture sensor
- LCD display (optional)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, power supply

## ⚡ Circuit Diagram
See `circuits/schematic.png` for wiring layout.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Connect sensors as per the circuit diagram.
2. Open `code/combined_system.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. Select board and port, then upload.
4. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud to view readings.
